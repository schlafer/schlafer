I'm Sazid. 

Just another person on the internet. 

I studied Electrical and Electronic Engineering majoring in Electronics. Finished with a 3.361 cgpa. Now I am working in as well as learning (with help from working professional buddies and kind wizards over the internet) software engineering, particularly focused on backend/server-side, system design, web security.

Hobbies:

While walking in parks, I like listening to technical podcasts about Linux, programming, open source, basically anything discussing technology ig?

Favorite podcasts in no particular order: 
- The Standup
- Backend Banter
- The freeCodeCamp.org Podcast
- The Changelog
- Gradient Dissent etc.

I create small, self-contained projects that integrate what I learn everyday. Usually they don't work but when they do, I go "Oh Baby A Triple!" xD 

My projects include shell scripting for tmux, i3wm/sway, lua scripting for nvim and wezterm, systemd-timers for automating menial tasks for my OS. 

Golang is my choice for working on backend development. I also use python from time to time. Postgres, Redis, SQlite, MySQL satisfies my database needs. 

When working with APIs I tend to use Insomnia more than cURL. 

I like to optimize everything I use from electronics to UI. Aside from keyboard layout which I use QWERTY and I'm not going to change it as I'm used to vim motions with it already.

My progress journal is done on Obsidian.md. I like to take my notes in markdown format. I use obsidian mainly because of the graph. Seeing my progress over a visualization keeps me going on. Motivates me to go beyond impending doom over uncertainty of the future.

Journaling for me creates a loop: experience → reflection → learning → action.

I lift weights everyday except Friday. I highly recommend everyone to lift heavy. Strengthens both memory and creativity as your body primes your brain.
